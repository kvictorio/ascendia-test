Resources used

## Route53

Sets the DNS Record for the Construction Site API

## API Gateway

REST API that handles the requests made for the Construction Site Logins. Forwards requests to the Cognito for Authentication and Lambda for further processing

## AWS Cognito

Uses User pools to handle the authentication. Returns with an authentication token that will authorize the login for the construction employees

## Lambda

Processes the requests (login/logout) of the employees. Login methods create PDFs that are stored in an S3 bucket. Another Lambda is triggered for every S3 event when a PDF file is stored and triggers SES for emailing

## S3 Buckets

Used as a storage for the static website for login, and for the PDF files generated. For every generated PDF file, an event triggers SES

## SES

Used to send the PDF files generated by the Lambda and added in S3. For every generated PDF file, an event triggers another Lambda that triggers the SES

## SNS

Used to send notification to the manager for every logout made by an employee
